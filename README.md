This is a fork of the repository to solve a problem we were having.

1954:    // when we use the local/session storage we perform the serialize, otherwise we let the passed storage implementation to do it
    const isLocalStorage = (hasLocalStorage() && storage === localStorage) || (hasSessionStorage() && storage === sessionStorage);
    observify(storage.getItem(key)).subscribe((value) => {
        let storageState = isObject(value) ? value : deserialize(value || '{}');
        function save(storeCache) {
            storageState['$cache'] = Object.assign({}, (storageState['$cache'] || {}), storeCache);
            storageState = Object.assign({}, storageState, acc);
            //@chriszrc TODO!!! I changed this so both strategies run serialize
            buffer.push(storage.setItem(key, isLocalStorage ? serialize(storageState) : serialize(storageState)));
            _save(buffer.shift());
        }
```

Akita is a state management pattern, built on top of RxJS, which takes the idea of multiple data stores from Flux and the immutable updates from Redux, along with the concept of streaming data, to create the Observable Data Stores model.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and gives powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.
